In the name of God
In this document, we talk about changing each joint values inside of "/sample/SimpleController/SR1Minimum.cpp".
For changing each joint initial value, there is a method named "Initialize" in every class. In this method, 
all the required
parameters are read from the main wrl file and stored in a Bodyptr object (for example ioBody). This ioBody contains 
the body joints as a vector of Linkptr. This Linkptr has a parameter named "q" in which all the joint values are stored in.
This class also has a memeber named "u" which represents the control signal value.
Following, a part of code is shown for turning the elbow joint.
