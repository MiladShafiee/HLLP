For Choreonoid, we need eclipse where it could be downloaded here:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
After unziping and executing the file, you may got the following errors:
1) JRE or JDK needed: Solution: in software center search Java and install jdk.
2) Your JDK version should be 1.8:
solution:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
